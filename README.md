# OneUI 6.x & 7.x Weather Complication (Lockscreen Widget) for Samsung Devices
This widget uses data and icons obtained from [Breezy Weather](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather) to display the current weather on lockscreen and AOD screens of Samsung devices running OneUI 6.x.

On OneUI devices, this widget will not show up in normal widget choosers, it may only be added to AOD & Lockscreens.

## Note
You'll need to enable data sharing in Breezy Weather's **Settings - Widgets & Live Wallpaper - Data sharing** for this app, otherwise the widget will always display "Unknown".
